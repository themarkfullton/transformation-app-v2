## FRONT END (React)

### [Back End](https://github.com/themarkfullton/transformation-api-v2) (Golang)

__Live Currently Deactivated; Attempting Move to GQL__

**STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Full Stack. Transforming the world into a safer place for the transgender community! App/API containing a variety of transgender resources (from trans-friendly clinics to information about how to change one's given name)!

## Technologies Used

- React
- Sass

## Motivation

Finding up-to-date resources as a transgender individual is tough, but essential: It can sometimes mean the difference between life and death. This app was created by transgender individuals for the purpose of making this information readily availiable *to* transgender individuals; to transform the world into a better place.

## Future Plans

The Transformation Team is currently collecting up-to-date information on trans-friendly clinics and working to connect with transgender content creators to provide helpful resources.

We are also considering a move to GQL and are experimenting with different API structures.
